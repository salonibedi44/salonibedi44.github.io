  - position: "Computer Vision Intern"
    company: "6th Player"
    date: "October 2025 - Present"

    description: "I'm working on researching & implementing ways in which we can better analyze video basketball footage. For example, I developed a human-in-the-loop pipeline using Roboflow and YOLO v8 for our team to mark incorrect basketball detections made by the model at test-time and retrain the model on these mistakes. I've also been creating a framework to evaluate multimodal language models on their long-video understanding capabilities (particularly Gemini)."

  - position: "Undergraduate Research Assistant"
    company: "Georgia Institute of Technology"
    date: "August 2024 - Present"

    description: "I am part of the Data-centric Machine Learning Lab advised by Dr. Steve Mussmann. In our first project, we developed a human-in-the-loop system that uses active learning and an interpretable image representation to efficiently train an image classifier. Currently, I am working on improving a model's domain generalization abilities by incorporating training label frequencies in two novel loss functions."

  - position: "Backend Software Engineering Intern"
    company:  "DoorDash"
    date: "May 2025 - August 2025"
    logo: "/images/doordash_logo.png"
    description: "I supported DashPass, DoorDash's subscription service that offers zero delivery fees and reduced service fees. Upsells are shown to certain users when they go to the checkout or cart page to advertise this subscription. I worked on setting up end-to-end tests for front-end engineers to ensure the functionality of these upsells (read about my work [here](https://careersatdoordash.com/blog/part-3-doordash-2025-summer-intern-projects/)!), and worked with product to implement an experiment on expanding upsells to new customer segments."

  - position: "Product Engineering Intern"
    company:  "Imagine Learning"
    date: "May 2024 - August 2024"
    logo: "/images/imagine_learning_logo.png"
    description: "I worked on MyPath, an online learning tool for K-12 students that allows them to catch up with their curriculum or maintain a faster pace. I consolidated two redundant microservices, added filtering functionality to a standards alignment tool, and worked on fixing bugs in the UI of a student's online individualized learning path."

  - position: "Undergraduate Teaching Assistant"
    company:  "Georgia Institute of Technology"
    date: "August 2023 - May 2024"
    logo: "/images/gt_logo.png"
    description: "I was a teaching assistant for the course Computer Organization and Programming. I taught a lab section of around 40 students twice a week on topics such as logical circuits, a simple computer datapath, assembly, and C. I maintained responsibilities such as helping students in office hours, grading assignments, and helping design course material."

  - position: "Machine Learning Intern"
    company:  "Noblis"
    date: "May 2023 - August 2023"
    logo: "/images/noblis_logo.jpeg"
    description: "My task was to find the best open-source models for text summarization. I spent time researching how (large) language models work, searched for the highest-performing models on this task, and used qualitative & quantitative metrics to compare their abilities. Fun fact, in the last week or so of my internship, Llama 2 came out and ended up performing better than most of the ones I had researched :)"
