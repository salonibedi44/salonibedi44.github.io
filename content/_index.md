I am currently finishing my undergraduate degree in <span style="color: maroon;">Computer Science at Georgia Tech</span>, with concentrations in Intelligence and Systems & Architecture. I'm grateful for the deep passion in technology & computing that I've developed here and hope to use it to make a positive impact on users of technology (and more broadly, the world!). 

My interests with this industry include <span style="color: maroon;">natural language processing, systems design, and AI/ML interpretability</span>. Through my experiences, I've learned that I enjoy solving challenging (engineering) problems and collaborating with other deep thinkers.

Above all, I value <span style="color: maroon">community & diversity of thought</span>. The communities in my life (family & friends, Startup Exchange @ GT, Alpha Kappa Psi) have given me a sense of belonging, life-long interests, and a desire to give back. Additionally, it is clear to me that diversity plays a major role in creativity and innovative thinking. And I love creativity! Wherever I go, I hope to champion these values. 

If you'd like to that chat about tech or believe I can do anything to help you in your journey, please reach out to me at salonibedi44@gmail.com.
