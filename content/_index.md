I am currently finishing my undergraduate degree in <span style="color: maroon;">Computer Science at Georgia Tech</span>, with concentrations in <span style="color: maroon;"> Intelligence and Systems & Architecture </span>. I'm grateful for the deep passion in technology & computing that I've developed here and hope to use it to make a positive impact on users of technology (and more broadly, the world!). 

I'm interested in <span style="color: maroon;"> machine learning safety & systems design </span>. I enjoy thinking about the real-world challenges machine learning systems suffer from and solving challenging (engineering) problems.

I strongly value <span style="color: maroon;">community</span> and <span style="color: maroon;">diversity of thought</span>. The communities in my life (family & friends, [Startup Exchange @ GT](https://www.startupexchangegt.org/), [Alpha Kappa Psi](https://gtakpsi.com/)) have given me a sense of belonging, life-long interests, and a desire to give back. Additionally, my experiences show me that diversity is essential to creativity and innovative thinking. And I love creativity! Wherever I go, I hope to advocate for these values.
